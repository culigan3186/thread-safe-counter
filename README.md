## What is Mutex and Semaphore respectively?

- **Semaphore**  : 
- **Mutex** :



## Execution time of Semaphore and Mutex 
I compared the performance of semaphore and mutex using Liuux's time command.
```
time ./mutex_count 1000000
```
```
time ./sema_count 1000000
```

## Why is there a difference in performance?
